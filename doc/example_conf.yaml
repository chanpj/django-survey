    chart: # This config is applied to all surveys
        min_cardinality: 0 # Display only answer with more this number of occurence
        group_together: # Permit to group answers together and replace them by a placeholder, for example :
            Agree:
          Yes, Rather yes
      Disagree:
                No, Rather No
        # It will group "yes" and "rather yes" under the placeholder "Agree" and
  # "No" and "Rather No" under the placeholder "Disagree"
        group_by_slugify: # Permit to group answer if their slugified value is the same
        group_by_letter_case: # Permit to group answer regardless of their capitalization
        sort_answer: # Permit to sort answers. Possible values are:
        # - None (Default to cardinal if we need to colorize in pgf-pie)
        # - "alphanumeric" (Alphanumeric)
        # - "cardinal" (Cardinality then alphanumeric)
        # - user defined ie { "Answer": "rank1", "OtherAnswer": "rank2"} will
        #   be sorted by value of the keys

        # The following option refer to pgfpie
        # See http://mirrors.ircam.fr/pub/CTAN/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgf-pie/pgf-pie-manual.pdf
        pos: {0,0} # Sets the centre of the chart to the value {⟨x⟩,⟨y⟩}.
        rotate: 0 # Rotates the chart by the given number of degrees.
        radius: 4 # Sets the radius of the chart.
        color: # Sets the colours for each segment.
        # The value should be a comma-separated list of colours corresponding
        # to each segment or a single colour, which indicates the colour for
        # the entire chart.
        explode: 0 # Offset the segments. The value may be a single number,
        # in which case all segments are offset by that amount, or the value
        # may be a comma-separated list of numbers where each value is the
        # offset amount for the corresponding segment.
        sum: 100 # The sum of all the data. This can be calculated automatically if
        # the auto option is set. If the auto option is off
        # and the actual data sum is less that this value there will be a
        # missing segment in the chart.
        auto: # A boolean key. If true, the sum of the data is calculated automatically.
        after number: \% # Indicates the text to place after the number shown in the segment. The default is \%.
        before number: # Indicates the text to place before the number shown in the segment.
        scale font: # A boolean key. If true, this scales the font used for the
        # inner label according to the size of the segment, so large segments
        # will have large inner labels and small segments will have small inner labels.
        text: legend # Indicates how to position the text (outer label). The value may
        # be one of
        # - label (place the text label outside the segment),
        # - pin (as label but also draws a line from the segment arc to the label),
        # - inside (place the text label inside the segment above the value)
        # - legend (create a legend). The default is label.
        style: drop shadow # Apply a shadow on the pie chart
        type: pie # a custom class name, sankey, raw, pie, cloud, square or polar
        # raw permit to read all the answers as quote. Useful for long unique answer
        # The polar area diagram is similar to a usual pie chart, except sectors
        # are equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends from
        # the center of the circle. Explode has no affects in square chart.
        # "sankey" permit to create a sankey chart linked to another question
        # A custom class name permit to provide your own Question2Tex() child
        # class and do everything you want as long as we can import it

    questions:
        Do you understand this is the full text of an example survey's question ?:
            chart: # the text for this pie chart will be "inside"
                text: inside
